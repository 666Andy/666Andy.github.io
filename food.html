Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add mushrooms and onions; saute until onions are transparent. Stir in pasta sauce, and heat through.
In a medium size bowl, combine cottage cheese, ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, and eggs.
Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce in the bottom of a 13x9 inch pan. Layer with uncooked lasagna noodles, cheese mixture, mozzarella cheese, and meat sauce. Continue layering until all ingredients are used, reserving 1/2 cup mozzarella. Cover pan with aluminum foil.
Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover, and top with remaining half cup of mozzarella cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes. Remove from oven, and let stand 10 to 15 minutes before serving.

  <h3 class="text-left">The Perfect Burger (aka The Crunch Burger)
    
Ingredients
    <br />

1½ pounds ground chuck (80/20)
    <br />
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
    <br />
Canola oil
    <br />
Thin slices of white American cheese
    <br />
Thin slices of white cheddar cheese
    <br />
Sliced beef steak tomatoes
    <br />
Sliced dill pickles
    <br />
Sliced red onion
    <br />
Romaine lettuce
    <br />
Martin's seeded soft burger buns
    <br />
Lay's potato chips
    <br />
6-inch wooden skewers
    <br />
Dijon mustard
    <br />
Horseradish mustard
    <br />
Ketchup
 <br />
Preparation
<br />
1. Form the meat into 4 equal-sized patties (6-ounces each) no more than ¾-inch thick.  
<br />
2. Using your thumb, make a deep depression in the center of each burger to keep the burger from puffing up and bulging in the center. 
<br />
3. Season the outside of the burger liberally with salt and pepper.  Do not season the meat mixture itself or add herbs or onions or garlic to it.  That is meatloaf.  We are making burgers.
<br />
4. Heat a cast iron pan or griddle over high heat until it begins to slightly smoke.  Add a few teaspoons of canola oil and put the burgers in the pan or on griddle and do not touch until a crust has formed on the bottom, this will take at least 3 minutes. Once a crust has formed, use a metal spatula and flip over and continue cooking until a crust has formed on the bottom and cooked to desired doneness (MEDIUM) another 4 minutes. DO NOT PRESS ON THE BURGER.
<br />
5. Place 2 slices of cheese on each burger add a few splashes of water and immediately cover the pan tightly and cook until cheese is completely melted, about 30 seconds.
<br />
6. A soft bun with sesame seeds is the way to go. Lightly toast the bun (if desired) and place the burger on the bottom of the bun. Add desired toppings and a few potato chips. Place top of bun on top and place a skewer through the burger.
